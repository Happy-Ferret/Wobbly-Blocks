Wobbly-Blocks
=============

Polyomino game similar to Tetris (albeit with a different gameplay/overall goal).

The overall goal of the game is to "build" a construct and maintain a steady height. Points accumulate over time but will stop for a brief time if the final row is removed. 

At certain times in the game, the ground will rumble, disallocating the connections between the minos. This event is usually followed by an animal dropping from the sky. It is essential that the animal neither falls nor knocks off too many building blocks.
